# ZigAsmVisualizer

This repo is just a sample build.zig script to add the option "zig build asm" so that I can visualize the assembly output of some code pattern, just saving it so that I can only get when I need to understand the underlining between things in a piece of zig code.

If you also what to use just write the pattern you want to analize inside test.zig and use the asm option when compiling and its going to output out.asm with most of the symbles still in there.
